# Thinking in Bets

Life is a lot more like Poker than it is like Chess. That is, because, it is theorized that one could theoritically win any winnable Chess game by playing with some small subset of logical rules. Poker, however, requires one to deal with player dynamics, game rules, luck, fortune, you-name-it. Poker players are adept at playing that game by thinking in terms of bets rather than through pure logical thought.

A research on bias in scientific research found that peer review was biased towards research that reinforces existing ideas, even if they have methodological issues, rather than new ideas that challenge our understanding. Researchers identified that betting on the ideas, instead of peer review, reduced the bias by a whopping 50000% because people were interested in being right than proving their ideas.
